# CPSC

For this assignment, we will be working with the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. This is a very famous data set and very often is a student's first step in Data Analytics!

The Dataset has been provided in D2L. We had to download the .csv file from the assignment folder. The second part of assignment 3 has 50 points.

The purpose is to pratice and perform some basic exploratory data analysis.

The 'data' folder contains the dataset 'Titanic' which we used for our analysis.

The 'src' folder contains the jupyter noterbook where we coded using Python to perform some basic analysis on the dataframe.

The 'Result' folder contains the final report which contains the graphs and inferences of the said analysis.

The 'doc' folder contains the link to get information on how to create READMEs. 

You can get further information on this dataset and analysis on Kaggle website which will be useful for this project.
